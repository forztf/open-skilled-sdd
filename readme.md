# Open Spec-Driven Development Skills (open-skilled-sdd)

[中文文档](./readme-zh.md)

**Enhancing AI coding assistants through open Spec-driven development (Spec-driven development for AI coding assistants), adopting the Claude Code Skills approach, compatible with various CLI and IDE AI coding assistants that support AGENTS.md.**

## Why?

When the code or documentation generated by an AI coding assistant is disappointing, it's unclear whether it's because:

1.  The large model's capabilities are problematic.
2.  The AI coding assistant is problematic: providing inappropriate context (including system prompts).
3.  The prompts I wrote are problematic.

The focus is on breaking through "2. The AI coding assistant is problematic", but because the built-in spec-driven development methods (context engineering, system prompts, etc.) of various CLI and IDE AI coding assistants are not public, they are basically black boxes, making it impossible to analyze or optimize them yourself. I looked for various **open** spec-driven development solutions, such as the 6A workflow, PRPs, Spec Kit, OpenSpec, spec-workflow-mcp, BMad-Method, etc., to see which one is the most suitable, and then proceed to optimize it myself. I roughly used these solutions and found that they each have their pros and cons. My first thought was to create a comprehensive solution, integrating the advantages of each solution and removing the parts I thought were unsuitable. I soon discovered that this path was a dead end; this idea is exactly the channel that various AI coding assistants are currently working on. I cannot do better than these vendors. Moreover, from a philosophical point of view, a comprehensive solution (limited capabilities) cannot adapt to all types of scenarios (infinite scenarios). At this time, Claude Code Skills came out. I found this approach good; wouldn't infinite skills be able to adapt to infinite scenarios? At the same time, I found [skilled-spec](https://github.com/mahidalhan/skilled-spec).

My idea is to convert OpenSpec, PRPs, Spec Kit, spec-workflow-mcp, BMad-Method, 6A workflow, etc., including good spec-driven development methods that appear in the future, into individual composable Skills, which are open and can be optimized by yourself.

Each skill has detailed documentation in its `SKILL.md` file.

## Install

**Copy directly to project (Claude Code, simple)**:

1.  Copy all subdirectories under `skills/` in this project to `.claude/skills/` in your project.
2.  Commit to version control.
3.  The team automatically gets the skills after cloning.

**Copy directly to global (Claude Code, simple)**:

1.  Copy all subdirectories under `skills/` in this project to `~/.claude/skills/`.

**Plugin-based (Claude Code, auto-update)**:

1.  Install the private marketplace repository:
   `/plugin marketplace add forztf/open-skilled-sdd` in Claude Code.
2.  Install plugins:
   `/plugin`
   -> `1. Browse and install plugins`
   -> `open-skilled-sdd-marketplace`
   -> Press space to select
   -> Press `i` to install in Claude Code.
   Or install them one by one using commands:
    ```
    /plugin install open-skilled-sdd@open-skilled-sdd-marketplace
    ```

**Other AI CLI/IDE Installation (for AI CLI/IDE that support AGENTS.md，Codex、Gemini、Cursor)**:

Use npx for direct installation:
```bash
npx open-skilled-sdd        # Install skills to .claude/skills/
npx open-skilled-sdd sync   # Sync skills to AGENTS.md
```

Or install globally then use the CLI:
```bash
npm install -g open-skilled-sdd

open-skilled-sdd            # Install skills locally
open-skilled-sdd install    # Explicit install command
open-skilled-sdd sync       # Sync to AGENTS.md
open-skilled-sdd --help     # Show help
```

**Sync Skills to AGENTS.md:**
```bash
open-skilled-sdd sync       # Auto-sync all skills (creates AGENTS.md if needed)
open-skilled-sdd sync --yes # Same as above (deprecated flag)
```

**Features:**
- Automatically creates AGENTS.md if it doesn't exist
- Syncs all installed skills to AGENTS.md (non-interactive by default)
- Updates existing skills section or creates new one
